SSTI Finder is designed to detect and identify Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities in web applications. SSTI vulnerabilities occur when user-controlled input is directly or indirectly included in server-side templates, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Features:

    Automated scanning: The tool performs automated scanning of web applications to identify potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
    Template engine support: It supports multiple popular template engines commonly used in web applications, such as Jinja2, Twig, Freemarker, and more.
    Payload injection: The tool injects custom payloads into user-controllable input fields and templates to detect potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
    Context-aware detection: It leverages context-aware techniques to reduce false positives by analyzing the context of template injection points.
    Reporting: It generates detailed reports highlighting the identified vulnerabilities, including vulnerable code snippets and recommendations for remediation.

Please note that this is a general description and the actual repository may contain additional features, documentation, and code examples.
